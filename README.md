Boy Scout Knots: 
Just like boy scouts learn various ways to twist string into knots, 
bsKnots is a list of functions for doing random things with strings.
Just like the knots one learns in boy scouts, however,
maybe 2 or 3 of the 30-odd knots are actually useful in daily life.

This is mostly a programming exercise for working with strings 
snark is intentional and added to make it interesting.
